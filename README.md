# ALIAS (Adding Layers of Information for the analysis of scRNA-seq data)

This is a first version of the codebase corresponding to our PrePrint [(bioRxiv)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.23.671699v1), where we show how small encoder-only language models can be used to generate a joint embedding space for scRNA-seq data with corresponding biomedical literature.

Please note that, as of now, not all evaluation functions shown in the PrePrint are implemented and the tutorials for using the repo are still WIP. We will have a ready to use repo within the next couple of weeks.
